# Ruby Run
### My attempt at creating a 2D game engine + game from scratch

Play as our dog Ruby as you look to jump over the lettuce and collect donuts!

This was made on a Mac so the .vscode folder is configured to work with it. You will have to mess around with it on other platforms.

To build and run on a Mac, download SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf and place in your /Library/Frameworks folder. Run the build script, and move the rubyrun executable file in the bin folder to the root folder of the repo. 

Have fun!
